                Global sea level is rising as a result of global warming. Oceans have absorbed around 85 percent of the excess heat trapped
                by the atmosphere since 1880. As ocean water warms, the water expands due to a process called "thermal expansion." This thermal
                expansion has been the main driver of global sea level rise after the start of the Industrial Revolution. However, in recent years, 
                the share of thermal expansion in global sea level rise has declined as the shrinking of land ice has accelerated.
